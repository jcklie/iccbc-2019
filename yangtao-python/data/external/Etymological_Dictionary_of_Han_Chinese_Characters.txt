meanings in the sense of the alternating point of a given day. *Horse* (as the seventh sign of the

# as described in 煕 (confine
in the jaw/mouth → confine). The addition of 女 woman indicated a woman confined within a
palace (compare 嫁) → female palace slave. Via the intermediary sense of "courtly retainer," the
character came to indicate a mistress, or court lady, and eventually a *princess*. *Honorific title for
a woman of high rank* is by association.

一　(1)　イチ；イツ；ひと；ひと（つ）

the fundamental idea is that of its cognate 壹 (unity of contents). 一 may therefore be regarded as
an abstract representation of unity, or fullness → *one*.

is actually 木 + a variant form of 舝. 舝 combines an abbreviated form of 牽 (drag/draw) + 韋

(circumambulate) → linchpin dragging on a wheel and hindering rotation (compare 轄). 桀 thus
originally indicated the idea of pinning a victim to a raised, wooden construction. Later, 桀 came to
refer to a *roost* as a different type of wooden construction raised high off the ground.
埶　(11)　ゲイ；う（える）
The relevant seal inscription form is 丮# kneeling figure with arms extended + an element
combining 手 hand/action indicator and 坴 as described in 陸 (stretched pile of earth) → kneel with

*weave*. 紝 was devised to replace 壬.

on the left in the form 亻. In many such characters (價 儗 仰 儆 偃 儀 etc.), 人 suggests human
agency, but there are others in which 人 has no semantic function at all. In these cases (伎 優 供 佑

傾 佹 etc.), 人 is used simply to create a derivative character conveying meanings that dropped

together two slender pieces of metal) → *pluck hair*. Also, an *attachment hung from a hairpin*.

this character is used as a substitute for the usual number (in this case, 二) in documents as a

meanings.

那　(7)　ナ　
The left-hand element# is a variant of 冄 as described in 冉 (supple). 那 adds 邑
(village/settlement), but the original form of the character had a different element than 邑. The
identity of this original form and the original meaning of the character are now obscure, although
the meaning was likely to have been connected with the concept "supple" as this concept is active in
derivative characters such as 娜, 挪 and 梛. *How*, *which*, *what*, and *that* are all borrowed
meanings. 那 is used in transliterations of terms such as 刹那 (Sanskrit: ksana), an instant.

characters involves not carving but rather pressing an implement downward into soft clay (compare

compound character that had been created according to the standard formation principle (one
phonosemantic element + one semantic element).

The present style is based on a bronzeware inscription form combining 夭 (a running figure) + 歮, a
variant of 歰 meaning "be stopped." However, neither 夭 nor 歮 can be the phonosemantic element
in 奔, and the meaning of 奔 (*run*) does not square with the sense "be stopped." Other
bronzeware forms show 夭 plus an obsolete element of unknown signification. As 奔 conveys the
concept "spread" in derivative characters such as 賁 and 鼖, the obsolete element may be posited to
have been connected with the idea of legs spread in running.

The relevant seal inscription form is 乂# (vegetation cut in swaths) + an element combining millet
and 殳 action indicator → harvest ears of millet and *scrape* them for their seeds → *shave*;
*erase*. The primary meaning, however, is now *kill*, via the conceptual progression from
"harvest" to "action that cuts off life." Compare 絶.
絶　(12)　ゼツ；た（える・つ・やす）
The relevant seal inscription form of the right-hand element# is an abbreviated form of 切 cut + 巴
(person spread flat on the ground) → cut people who have submitted into pieces → *kill (off)*
(compare 殺). The addition of 糸 thread indicates "cut animate and inanimate things into pieces" →

竊　(22)　セツ　 Shinjitai　窃　(9)

水 water (→ liquid) → *lacquer* tree.
自　(6)　ジ；シ；みずか（ら）
A depiction of a nose. Conceptually, the character suggests slender streams of breath passing
through the nostrils (compare 四) of a stumpy nose. *Self* is an extended meaning (← point toward
one's nose to indicate self) → *by/for oneself*; *originally*; *from*.
四　(5)　シ；よ；よ（つ・っつ）；よん
The relevant oracle bone form of this character is four horizontal lines indicating *four* →
*fourth*; *four times*. The present form derives from SIS, which is 口 mouth + 八 split right and
left → splitting off/dispersal of breath through the nostrils to right and left (compare 自). Earlier, a
bronzeware inscription form combined 口 with the horizontal lines of the oracle bone form
(repositioned) to suggest the same idea of dispersal of breath. In that sense, the application of the
meaning "four" to the present character represents a borrowed meaning.
疾　(10)　シツ　
矢 here an abbreviated form# of 至 stopping point + 疒 illness → *illness* hastening death →
*swiftness* (← hasten).
卩　(2)　セツ　
A depiction of a *kneeling figure/person*. *Tally/check* is via a once-separate character that came

primarily for transliterations of Buddhist terminology, such as 刹那 (Sanskrit: ksana), an instant.
*Temple* and *monastery* (example: 禅刹) are therefore borrowed meanings.
薩　(17)　サツ；よもぎ　
The lower element# combines 産 (life-sustaining) + 阜 piled earth. The meaning of this character is
obscure. 薩 adds 艸 grass/plant → a species of mugwort (compare 薛). However, 薩 came to be
used for transliteration purposes, as in 菩薩 for bodhisattva (roughly, one who helps sentient beings
attain Buddhahood).
脆　(10)　ゼイ；もろ（い）　
Originally 脃, which is as per the obsolete right-hand element# described in 絶 (cut into pieces) +
肉 flesh → severed body parts → *fragile*; *brittle* (← easily broken) → *susceptible*;

independent character with the meaning "gland."

世# successive + 糸 thread → *tether* (by which a succession of animals/slaves/criminals etc.
follow in line) → *bind/tie*. 絏, a variant form of 紲 (or one perhaps better regarded as an
independent character) appears in the compound 縲絏 (a long rope for binding criminals, and, by
extension, to a jail/prison). Note also another variant form, 緤.
蔡　(14)　サイ　
As per 祭# (scrape) + 艸 grass/plant → scrape off the tops of vegetation (compare 薛) → *short

鵤　(18)　いかる；いかるが　
角 horn + 鳥 bird → *grosbeak* (← bird with a large bill likened to a horn).
栃　(9)　とち
栃 is a character with a particularly convoluted etymology. The variant form 杤 combines 木
tree/wood + 万 ten thousand. One element of traditional shrine and farmhouse architecture in Japan
is a pair of crossing pieces of timber on the roof atop the respective ends of the ridgepole. This
feature is designated ちぎ (千木), 千 and 木 being pronounced with their KUN readings ち and き
(here in the voiced consonant form ぎ). As it happened, a shrine now located within the Tochigi
castle precincts had such pairs of ちぎ. Appending the native Japanese term for (と) yields とちぎ,
while prefixing the character for (十) to 千木 yields 十千木. Read literally, the combination 十千
means "ten thousand," but in Han/Chinese characters ten thousand is written with the single
character 万. Thus was devised the Made-in-Japan character 杤, retaining the 木 portion of 十千木
while replacing 十千 with 万. During the Meiji Era, however, 万 was superseded by the element
seen in the left-hand side of 励, 栃 becoming the standard form of the character. As for the tree
known as とち (short for とちのき), this is the (Japanese) *horse chestnut* (Aesculus turbinata). For
horse chestnut, compare 橡, which also has the KUN reading とち.
纃　(20)　かすり
齊 arrange + 糸 thread → (fabric with a) *splashed pattern* (← neatly arranged pattern). 緕 is a

盡 here an abbreviated form of 儘 for the KUN reading まま + 土 earth → *steep bluff*. Compare

十 ten → one *decaliter*.

meaning one *milliliter*.

百 one hundred → one *hectoliter*.

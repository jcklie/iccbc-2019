The phonetically close term conveyed by 㒼 (described in 満) suggests that 美, like 㒼, involved the notion "cover the body completely with an animal skin that has its head still attached." The exact provenance of the meanings *beautiful* and *good* is uncertain, as is the identity of the element replaced by 大.

However, 者 was borrowed for use as a demonstrative pronoun, later evolving in meaning to the sense of "the one who does this" → *person*. The present form of 者 and certain derivative characters of 者 eliminate a diagonal stroke above 日, such as is retained for example in 堵, 屠 or 奢.

西	xī	west, western, westward	⿻兀囗	pictographic			A bird settling into its nest, representing sunset; compare 東	A depiction of a nest in which chicks are neatly aligned. *West* is either a borrowed or an extended meaning; in the latter case the idea might be that of the reddish sun aligned with the horizon at sunset. (For "reddish," compare 茜.) By further extension is *the Pure Land*, Buddhism having entered China from lands west.
要	yào	essential, necessary; to ask for; to coerce; to demand	⿱覀女	ideographic			A woman 女 with hands on her waist 覀	The relevant bronzeware inscription form is 女 woman + an element combining a pair of hands and a backbone → compress a woman's waist, creating curvaceous hips → waist; hips → *main point*; *vital* (← hips as the pivot point of the body) → *brief*; *sum up*; *in short*.

那	nà	that, that one, those	⿰⿹？？阝					The left-hand element# is a variant of 冄 as described in 冉 (supple). 那 adds 邑 (village/settlement), but the original form of the character had a different element than 邑. The identity of this original form and the original meaning of the character are now obscure, although the meaning was likely to have been connected with the concept "supple" as this concept is active in derivative characters such as 娜, 挪 and 梛. *How*, *which*, *what*, and *that* are all borrowed meanings. 那 is used in transliterations of terms such as 刹那 (Sanskrit: ksana), an instant.

# App usage

The app has three screens. When opening, it starts in the collection screen where all included
Hanzi can be viewed. Clicking on a Hanzi opens its detail screen, showing information about
meaning, mnemonic, decomposition and more. The mnemonic can be changed and saved with the
buttin in the top right corner.

From the main screen, when clicking on the camera+ button in the bottom left, the AR view
can be openend. At first, planes have to be detected, e.g. a table top. For this, the phone
needs to be moved around left and right until plane indicator in form of dots appear. Then
you are ready to scan Hanzi. The character should be aligned to the focus in the middle of the
screen and scanned from the top. When pressing the scanning button, it then opens a menu.
If the character is correct, it can be directly accepted. If it can be found in the dropdown
list, it can be selected and then accepted. After accepting, the hanzi in 3D appears. One can
move around and investigate its composition and shape as if it was a real object. It can be
removed by clicking on the X or one can switch to the details view by clicking on the (i).

If it was totally wrong, then it needs to be scanned again. Typical problems we encountered are
shadows, noisy background or only partially capturing the Hanzi. In the main view, the settings
menue in the top right can be used to activate the debug view. It shows more information during
scanning about how the app processes the image.
